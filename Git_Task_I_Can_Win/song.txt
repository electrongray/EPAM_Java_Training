Krept & Konan (wo wo wo)

The ting set, the ting dead it
Trust me, headshot them bumbaclart
(Sorcerer)
Yeah, blowing smoke in the air
Bad ting on her knees
Now I'm holding up her hair, wo wo wo
Elastic band, you came prepared, wo wo wo
Don't get saliva on the chair, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo

The fakes never last, wo wo wo
She didn't rate me at the start, wo wo wo
Now she wanna hit me like it's calm, wo wo wo
Sorry bitch, you missed your chance, wo wo wo
Had her mans in her hands, wo wo wo
Hundred leng for the, wo wo wo
Hefner with the juice, wo wo wo
Skepta with the moves, wo wo wo

Realer than a lot of mans, wo wo wo (facts)

It came in elastic bands, wo wo wo
Bitches on the xans, wo wo wo
Got your missus in my pants, wo wo wo
Whizzing in the Benz, wo wo wo
And I did it for the ends, wo wo wo
Yeah, blowing smoke in the air
Bad ting on her knees
Now I'm holding up her hair, wo wo wo
Elastic band, you came prepared, wo wo wo
Don't get saliva on the chair, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo

That's my cousin on the phone, wo wo wo
Had to send him in a drone, wo wo wo
Yellow diamonds, see the stones
When you're talking, watch your tone, wo wo wo
Chinchilla, see the fur, wo wo wo
Push a button and I skur, wo wo wo
See a big batty, I reverse, wo wo wo
Like "How you get that in a skirt?", wo wo wo
That's your sister in the back, wo wo
Taking pictures in my hat, wo wo
Tryna get me in a snap, wo wo wo
Put my city on the map, wo wo

Twenty bottles, bring me more, wo wo wo (behave)
You nearly stepped on my Diors, wo wo wo
Yeah, blowing smoke in the air
Bad ting on her knees
Now I'm holding up her hair, wo wo wo
Elastic band, you came prepared, wo wo wo
Don't get saliva on the chair, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo
Wo wo wo, wo wo wo
